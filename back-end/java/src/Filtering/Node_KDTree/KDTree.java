/**
 * The {@code KDTree} class is a hierarchical data structure that organizes
 * {@link DormRoom} instances according to multiple categorical attributes:
 * {@link DormBuilding}, suite availability, kitchen availability, and
 * {@link BathroomType} respectively.
 *
 * <p>Internally, it maintains a nested {@link HashMap} structure keyed by these
 * categorical attributes, ultimately storing rooms in {@link KDTreeNode} instances, which
 * themselves manage spatial (k=3 dimensions) searching of rooms based on the
 * square footage, people per washer, and room capacity.
 *
 * <p>The outer layers of these nested maps categorize rooms, while the
 * {@link KDTreeNode} at the leaves is responsible for efficient quantitative
 * queries and filtering.
 *
 * <p>This class implements the {@link IDormFilter} interface, allowing it to
 * be integrated with other dorm filtering systems.
